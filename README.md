# The Bermondsey Review — step 1: design shell

This is the static front end from the tech plan's step 1: homepage, archive,
and individual article pages, styled and laid out, with mock data instead
of a real database. No Supabase, no auth, no email — that's step 2 onward.

## What's here

- `app/page.jsx` — homepage (featured article, "from this issue" extras, article list, newsletter band)
- `app/archive/page.jsx` — full archive, reverse-chronological, filterable by category
- `app/article/[slug]/page.jsx` — individual article page
- `app/crossword`, `app/geoguesser` — stub pages, built out in phase 2
- `components/Masthead.jsx` — header with the illustrated skyline banner and nav
- `components/CoverArt.jsx` — placeholder line-illustration "covers" per category, swap for real images later
- `lib/articles.js` — mock article data, shaped to match the future `articles` table so swapping in real data is mostly a search-and-replace

## Design system

- **Colours:** paper `#FFFFFF`, ink `#1C1B17`, brick `#9C6B42` (warm warehouse brick/tan brown), river `#2B4C73` (dockside/Thames blue), mustard `#D3A121` (defined but currently unused), steel `#6E6C63` — a brown-and-blue duo drawn from the local warehouse brick and "Blue Bermondsey" shopping-area colours, rather than a generic template palette.
- **Type:** Zilla Slab for headlines (a free, commercially-usable slab serif in the same family as the DK Southwark reference you linked, which is personal-use-only), Source Serif 4 for article body copy, Inter for nav/captions/UI.
- **Signature element:** the hand-drawn skyline strip in the masthead (crane, warehouse, the Shard, river) — this is the one illustrated flourish; everything else stays quiet and newspaper-like on purpose.

## Running it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Admin (step 2 + 3: the real editing flow)

Articles, videos, podcasts, and cartoons are now editable through a real
`/admin` area backed by Supabase — this is no longer mock data.

### One-time setup

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the SQL editor, run everything in `supabase/schema.sql` — this creates
   the `posts`, `subscribers`, `crosswords`, and `issues` tables plus the
   Row Level Security policies.
3. In **Storage**, create a new **public** bucket named `media`, then run the
   two `create policy` statements commented at the bottom of `schema.sql`
   (they're commented out because the bucket has to exist first).
4. In **Authentication → Users**, manually add an account for yourself and
   each co-editor (email + password). There's no public sign-up — this is a
   small trusted team, not an open platform.
5. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your project's URL
   and anon key (Project Settings → API in the Supabase dashboard).
6. `npm install && npm run dev`, then visit `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`.

### What you get

- `/admin` — every post, draft and published, with a type badge and status
- **`/admin/forms` — a general-purpose form builder**, not just the
  newsletter signup. Build a form with any mix of short text, long
  text, email, dropdown, and checkbox fields — drag to reorder them the
  same way article blocks reorder, mark any field required, publish it,
  and it's live at `/forms/[slug]`. Responses land in `/admin/forms/[id]/submissions`,
  readable by admins only. A hidden honeypot field on the public form
  gives basic spam protection without needing a CAPTCHA.
- **`/admin/theme` — "Design."** A visual theme editor: two colour
  pickers (the brick and river accents), two font pickers (headline and
  body, from a curated list of real Google Fonts), and an "Advanced:
  Code injection" section for raw custom CSS/JS — with the same live
  device preview as everywhere else. Deliberately narrow: paper, ink,
  and hairline colours stay fixed in code, so there's no way to
  accidentally pick black-on-black and make the whole site unreadable.
  Worth knowing how this actually works — it's not cosmetic paint
  splashed on top:
  - Colours and fonts used to be hardcoded values scattered across SVG
    icons and inline styles (the masthead skyline, the cover-art
    placeholders, the puzzle cards, the drop-cap letter). All of that
    was rewired to route through CSS custom properties
    (`--color-brick`, `--color-river`, `--font-display`, `--font-body`)
    with sensible fallbacks — see `tailwind.config.js` and
    `components/ThemeVars.jsx` — specifically so this editor wouldn't
    be the kind of feature that changes some things and silently misses
    others.
  - `ThemeVars` is included only in public-facing pages (the homepage,
    archive, article, etc.), never in `/admin`'s own dashboard pages —
    so admin chrome always stays on the fixed default design system, the
    same way Squarespace's own editor UI doesn't reskin itself based on
    your site's custom theme.
  - The custom JS field is real, unsandboxed code that runs for every
    visitor — restricted to admins by RLS, with a clear warning in the
    UI, but worth treating with the same care as editing the repository
    directly.
- **`/admin/site` — site identity, navigation, and footer.** Title,
  tagline, and logo (upload one and it replaces the text title in the
  masthead); a drag-to-reorder navigation menu shown in both the masthead
  and the footer; social links (Twitter/X, Instagram, Facebook — shown as
  footer icons, only for whichever you fill in); and an optional footer
  note (address, charity number, whatever belongs in small print). All of
  it lives in the same `site_settings` row as `/admin/theme`'s colours and
  fonts (see `lib/theme.js`), so there's one place that owns "what does
  this site look/say like," not several. See `components/Masthead.jsx`
  and the new `components/Footer.jsx` for how it's actually applied.
- **`/admin/redirects` — automatic and manual redirects.** Rename a
  post's URL in the SEO section and a redirect from the old address to
  the new one is created automatically (see `updatePost` in
  `lib/posts.js`), so old links and search results don't just 404.
  Resolved in `proxy.js`, scoped to `/article/*` only on purpose —
  checking every single request against the database would be needless
  overhead for a feature that's used occasionally. Add one manually here
  too, e.g. for an old external URL.
- **`/admin/analytics` — a minimal, privacy-friendly pageview
  dashboard.** No cookies, no per-visitor tracking, just "this path was
  viewed at this time" — enough to answer "which articles are people
  actually reading." The tracker lives in `components/PageViewTracker.jsx`
  and is deliberately wired into the real public pages directly (homepage,
  archive, article), not into `HomePageBody`, since that component is
  shared with the admin layout-builder's live preview — previews
  shouldn't count as visits.
- **Image optimization** — every image (cover images, body images,
  media library thumbnails) now renders through `next/image` instead of
  a raw `<img>` tag. Uploads to Supabase Storage aren't compressed or
  resized on their own, so this is what actually keeps the site fast:
  automatic resizing, lazy loading, and modern formats (WebP/AVIF) are
  handled for you the moment this is deployed to Vercel — see the
  `images.remotePatterns` entry in `next.config.mjs`.
- **Roles: admin vs. contributor** — new editor accounts default to
  "contributor" (see the `profiles` table and its auto-create trigger in
  `supabase/schema.sql`). Contributors can write and save drafts;
  publishing, scheduling, deleting posts, deleting media, and editing
  the homepage layout are admin-only — and this is enforced by the
  database's row-level security, not just hidden buttons, so it holds
  even if there's a bug in the UI. To make yourself (or anyone) an
  admin, run the one-line SQL comment above the `profiles` table once
  they've signed in at least once.
- **A real sitemap and robots.txt** (`app/sitemap.js`, `app/robots.js`)
  — built from actual published posts once Supabase is connected, with
  a graceful fallback to just the static routes if it isn't yet. Set
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `.env.local` once you have a real domain.
- **SEO & sharing fields** — a collapsible "SEO & sharing" section in the
  editor with an editable URL slug (auto-generated from the title, but
  overridable), a meta description with a 155-character guide, and a
  social share image (falls back to the cover image if left blank).
  These aren't just stored — the preview page's `generateMetadata`
  actually reads them into real `<title>`/`<meta>` tags, so you can
  verify they're working by viewing the page source of a preview.
- **Version history** — every explicit Save draft / Publish / Schedule /
  Update saves a snapshot. The "History" button in the editor lists
  every version with a timestamp and a one-click "Restore." This is
  separate from autosave on purpose: autosave protects against losing
  work between checkpoints (e.g. a browser crash mid-sentence);
  revisions protect against a checkpoint itself being a mistake (e.g.
  publishing over a paragraph you actually wanted to keep). Restoring
  brings back the *content* — title, body, images — without touching
  the post's current live status, so restoring an old draft can't
  accidentally un-publish something that's since gone live.
- **Scheduled publishing** — pick a "Schedule for" date/time in the
  editor and the primary button becomes "Schedule" instead of "Publish."
  The post goes live on its own at that moment — no cron job or server
  function required, since the database's own row-level security rule
  treats a scheduled post as publicly visible the instant its time
  arrives (see the comment above the "Public can read published posts"
  policy in `supabase/schema.sql`). The trade-off, documented right there
  in the schema: the `status` column stays literally `scheduled` forever
  unless someone reopens the post — the admin list and editor compute
  "is this actually live?" the same way the database policy does, so
  what you see in `/admin` always matches what visitors see.
- **`/admin/media` — a real media library.** Every image uploaded
  anywhere (cover images, body images) is automatically recorded in a
  `media_library` table, not just attached to whatever it was uploaded
  for. Browse and delete everything from `/admin/media`, or click
  "Choose from library" wherever you're adding an image to reuse one
  instead of re-uploading it.
- **`/admin/layout` — the visual page-layout builder.** Drag whole
  sections (Featured Article, Puzzles & Games, Article Carousel,
  Newsletter Signup) into a new order, or untick one to hide it from the
  homepage entirely, with a live device preview (mobile/tablet/desktop)
  right next to the section list. Autosaves the same way the post editor
  does. This is backed by a real `page_layouts` table — the homepage
  isn't hardcoded to one fixed section order any more, it renders
  whatever order is saved there (see `components/HomePageBody.jsx`,
  shared by both the public homepage and the builder's preview, so they
  can never drift out of sync).
- `/admin/posts/new` — a type picker (article/video/podcast/cartoon) with
  plain-language descriptions instead of jargon
- **The editor looks like the finished page, not a form** — the headline
  and standfirst fields are styled exactly like they'll appear once
  published, so you're always looking at something close to the real
  page rather than a stack of generic text boxes
- **Rich text paragraphs** — select text to bold it, italicise it, or turn
  it into a link, right in the editor (see `components/admin/RichParagraph.jsx`)
- **Six block types** — paragraph, image, heading, quote, button, and
  divider, so a piece can be more than a wall of paragraphs (a pull quote,
  a call-to-action button linking to a form, a section break) without
  needing a full page-builder. See `components/admin/BlockEditor.jsx` for
  editing and `components/PostRenderer.jsx` for how each renders.
- **Drag-and-drop** — reorder blocks by dragging the ⠿ handle, and drop
  image files straight from the desktop onto the cover image or an image
  block instead of hunting for a file picker
  (see `ImageDropzone` in `components/admin/BlockEditor.jsx`)
- **A sticky action bar** — Save draft / Publish / Preview stay visible
  at the top of the screen no matter how far down you've scrolled
- **Autosaves** about 1.5 seconds after you stop typing, once a post has
  been created — there's no "did I remember to save?" moment
- **Preview** — every post has a "Preview" link that shows exactly how
  it'll look on the actual site, before it's published, with a **Mobile /
  Tablet / Desktop switcher** at the top. This uses a real iframe sized to
  each device's width (the same trick browser dev tools use), so the
  mobile hamburger menu and other responsive behaviour genuinely kick in —
  not just a narrower window showing the desktop layout.
- **Delete** — a plain-language confirmation before anything is removed
- Friendly error messages instead of raw database errors

**What's deliberately not built yet:** the public-facing pages
(`app/page.jsx`, `app/archive`, `app/article/[slug]`) still read from the
mock data in `lib/articles.js`, not from Supabase — wiring them to real
data, and upgrading the block editor to support inline video/podcast
embeds (step 10 of the build order), are the natural next steps.

## Next steps (from the tech plan)

1. ~~Static design shell~~ ← done
2. ~~Supabase schema~~ ← done (`supabase/schema.sql`)
3. ~~`/admin` editing flow~~ ← done, plain block editor (no embeds yet)
4. Wire the public pages (homepage, archive, article) to read real post *content* from Supabase instead of `lib/articles.js` — note the homepage's section *order* is already real (`page_layouts`, via the layout builder); it's just the articles inside those sections that are still mock data
5. Newsletter signup + subscriber storage
6. Email sending pipeline (Resend)
7. Crossword widget
8. Guess-the-spot game
9. Video support (`/watch/[slug]`)
10. Podcast support (`/listen/[slug]` + `/feed.xml` RSS)
11. Inline embeds in the article editor, once 9–10 exist to embed
